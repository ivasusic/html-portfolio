<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Iva, a begginer developer and i have started making websites and learning 
  all there is to learn about creating (currently) simple and clean websites. I'm really exited about my journey
   and all there is to know in front-end design.
  My focus is to practise and become an excelent full stack developer, a proces i quite enjoy.
  As of right now i am making small projects that will hone in my development skills and build my portfolio.

  When i am not coding and learning i enojoy reading, knitting and playing the piano for the most part.
  What sparked my interest in programing and design is watching one of my very close friends build an app.
  At the time i worked as a nanny for more than 4 years with the same family, a job that i adored but 
  could not see myself doing forever. When i discovered web design and development i found it very intriguing and mentaly stimulating.

  I'm excited as i get on this journey of learning and developing skills, and i am motivated to grow as a developer.
  If you have any feedback, critique or new learning opprotunities i am always open to it.
