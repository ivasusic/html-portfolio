 <h1>The Best Movies Acording to Iva</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Little Women</h3>
 <p>It's loosely based on a novel written in 1868 by an author called 
    Louisa May Allcot. It's an 2019 adaptation that i loved beacuse it's 
    raw and honest and it depicts women and their relationship with their 
    sisters and it has a monologe about women and what we feel our role is 
    in a society, and when u are unwilling to fit that role, and the fear 
    that comes with doing so. It's about love and life and realtionships
    and fear, and i feel like the director Greta Gerwig made a really 
    beutiful movie that has a love aspect but it's sentered about women.
    It might be my favourtie movie so far.

 <h3>Call me By Your Name</h3>
 <p>If i was truly honest, i would tell u that this is my sisters favourite 
    movie, but it bacema one of mine through her. It's a queer movie, but i 
    loved it beacuse it's a love movie, it's also raw and honest and it doesn't 
    have a happy ending which i typically don't like but my sister does, but 
    it doesn't need it. The story as such, it wouldn't make sense for it to
    have a happy ending. One of my favourite quotes comes from this movie. "We 
    rip out so much of ourselves to heal faster, that we become bancrupt by the age of forty."

 <h3>Fleabag</h3>
 <p>Not a movie, but in truth i don't have a third favourite movie,however,having
    watched this series in one sitting everytime, i would consider it close enough
    to be applicable for it to be mentioned. It's the absolute series that has changed
    my life, to the point where me and my sister quote it more than anything else.
    It's honest,raw,funny deep (yes u are noticing a pattern, i adore movies
    and series and honestly everything that is raw) One of my favourite quotes from
    this series is "I think u know how to love better than most of us, that's why
    u find it all so painful." It was first written as a play by Phoebe Waller-Bridge
    It feels as if she put herself completely in it, and the human imperfections, and 
    she made it ok to have them. I adore this series and could probably talk about it
    for hours.But i will spare you the agony.
